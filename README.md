# CodeAlpha_DataAnalytics
📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow using real-world web data. It covers the complete pipeline from data collection to insight generation, combining web scraping, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and sentiment analysis.

The project starts with web scraping, where relevant data is extracted from online sources using automated scripts. The raw data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Next, EDA is performed to explore patterns, trends, and relationships in the dataset. Statistical summaries and visual exploration help in understanding the structure and behavior of the data.

The project includes data visualization to present insights through plots such as bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and word clouds, making the results easy to interpret.

Finally, sentiment analysis is applied to textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, enabling a deeper understanding of user opinions and trends.

This repository showcases practical skills in data collection, analysis, visualization, and NLP, and serves as a reference for building real-world data projects.
